She's no more than 2 years old, still a young lady. She's an affectionate and intelligent cat that prefers a quiet, mellow environment. I think her type of coat coloring is called Black Smoke. The little black tabby with striped legs is Luna. She's a female kitten, about 3 weeks old now and looks just like her mummy. She's the lazier of the two kittens. She loves sleeping and cuddling up with Snowy all day. The silver tabby is Rajah. I've named him after Princess Jasmine's pet tiger in Disney's Aladdin cartoon. He's more adventurous than his cozy, comfort-loving sister. Every time I check on them, he's awake and looking at me with wide eyes. The kittens will be ready for adoption in about 4-6 weeks time, once they are fully weaned and litter-trained. Snowy will be ready for adoption once her kittens are fully weaned and she has been spayed. - Set up a meeting with me and the pet of your choice. - We'll have a chat and see if you and kitty are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. Although I do volunteer with the Selangor SPCA in my free time, I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter.

Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cats are more aggressive..

But Gerbera has a habit and we do not know why she has such habit..most of the time when we stand near the window she will quickly run towards the window and climb on the window grill, as if like she's making a performance and telling us that she's good on this (we tried to stop her at the beginning but still..she want to let us know that she's good at this..a spider-cat Gerbera! :P) Gerbera behaves very good on bathing time but she do not like to share her food and toy with her friends. She can eat together with friends if in different bowl but when they re eating same bowl of food, she will be very nervous and lift up her front paw to stop anyone from nearing the bowl but of course she do not bite or hurt anyone.. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - Always keep cat indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat her like your own precious family members Please give a home to Gerbera \u2665.

She is timid but gentle and very intelligent. She thinks the best place in the world is to be near her human at all times. She will insist on joining you when you watch TV, use the computer, cook, use the toilet, shower and will even try to help you choose the clothes to wear. She looks like a Siamese cat, but she is a local street-born, complete with a double-kink tail. Also like a Siamese cat, she has a wide vocabulary of sounds from cute raspy squeaks to out-loud cries. Her purr motor is loud and turns on very easily. Shiro has a silky soft coat and greatly enjoys playing with her toys and getting her fur brushed. 11 March . Rescued from the streets and was covered with filth, car grease and was mostly skin and bones. 12 March . Shiro was taken to the vet where she was de-wormed and de-fleaed and given antibiotics. She weighed g on that day and pronounced to be a girl and 2 and half months old. 30 March . Shiro was given her first vaccination and was de-wormed again. Her weight has shot up to 1.25kg. The vet thought that she is closer to 3 and half months old at this point. 29 Apr . Done with the second jab and she weighed 1.75kg. 27 May . Done with the third and final vaccination jab. Her weight at this point is 2.15kg. 3 June . Spayed. The adopter shall receive her vaccination card and medical records from the vet. Current diet: * Dr. Gary's Best Breed kibbles. Taste of the Wild cat kibbles. * 2 meals per day of fresh raw chicken/beef pieces mixed with either one of these canned food \u2013 Fancy Feast, Monge and Fussie Cat. Or mixed with bonito/sardine flakes (the type sold in Japanese food section) * Favourite treat \u2013 washed and blanched ikan bilis mixed with raw chicken. * Also eats raw chicken neck chopped to small kitty bite sizes. Given no more than once a week as it can cause constipation. * She enjoys Farm Fresh plain yoghurt. * As treats, she likes Greenies Roasted Chicken Dental Cat and Greenies Smartbites Skin & Fur Salmon. Cat litter \u2013 Shiro currently uses Cat's Best by \u00d6koPlus. She loves clean litter boxes and is obsessed with how the flushing toilet works. Suitable adopter \u2013 a person who can: * Give Shiro safe indoor environment. * Offer a \"safe room\" to slowly introduce Shiro to her new home. The room must be big enough to put in her litter box, a pet carrier with her toys and bowls of food and water. This is important to ensure she does not freak out when she sees so many new things and people. The room could be a spare toilet or a large pet cage or even the bedroom so that she can sleep with you at night. * Ensure that Shiro is kept indoors always. * Put up with her crying and hiding during the intro period. Shiro is a shy timid cat and she will hide and probably cry for the first few days in her new home. Please be understanding and spend as much time as possible with her to gain her trust and love. * Give Shiro a companion. Shiro hates to be alone. The companion could be a younger cat or a human. *Provide her with nutritous meals suitable for a cat. NOT suitable adopter \u2013 a home that: * Leaves Shiro many hours alone. * Has an \"open door\u201d policy \u2013 Shiro cannot survive outdoors. To be outdoors, a cat has to have some tough badass attitude, and Shiro has none of it. She is just a complete sweetheart who wants manja and sayang.

A friend was walking his dogs when they suddenly became excited outside an apartment complex and sniffed out a shoe box. Inside the shoe box was little Charlie! He was about 6 weeks old then, emaciated and dehydrated, just a scrap of skin and bones. He had a bad tummy virus but survived it after two weeks of antibiotics. Now he needs a permanent home! Charlie is very active, playful, and affectionate. He likes playing with other cats and sitting on people's laps. He uses his litterbox without fail. Charlie is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Charlie are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Charlie started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Prison is punishment! Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please.

Description: This kitten which I named him Brave,was lying lifeless under the dark staircase of my condo. I guess Brave was not meant to end his life there, he managed to meow softly which somehow caught my attention. I quickly picked him up and was shocked to see that Brave was so skinny and could barely walk. Brave's body was so cold and his eyes were half opened. Without any hesitation, I used a thick towel to wrap him up and tried to hand feed him with some wetfood,he refused to eat, fed him with some milk and water, he refused to drink, Brave was simply too weak to eat and drink. Brave was infected by a virus similar to that of parvo virus in a dog. That night, Brave was just lying and closed his eyes with heavy breath and i thought that he might not be able to make it to the next day. However, in the middle of the night, i heard a soft meow, it was Brave ! he was meowing to me ! he managed to raise up his little head eventhough he still could not stand up and walk. Immediately, i fed him some milk and water and he drank ! i monitored Brave's condition throughout the night (he was having severe diarrhea as well) and rushed him to the vet, Dr. Tan (2nd chance panel vet) the next morning. Dr. Tan said by looking at Brave's terrible condition and based on her experience, normally kitten infected with this kind of virus and with such a low body temperature as well as severe diarrhea, Brave had a very low chance to pull through. Brave was hospitalised and continue to be monitored and i, already prepared to receive call from the Dr. Tan anytime about the bad news on Brave, However, Brave has such a strong will to live, he began to perk up the next day, he can stand up and walk, he started to eat and drink by himself ! Yesterday, i dropped by at the clinic and Dr. Tan said that Brave's temperature has gone back to normal despite a bit of a diarrhoea. Brave not only ate and drank on his own, he even walked out from the cage and greeted me with a loud meow ! After a while, he started to groom himself ! What a joy! So, this is a wonderful and happy story about Brave and i hope that someone can foster Brave or better still, adopt him ! because Brave definitely deserves to be loved, doesn't he ? I hope that someone is kind enough to foster him. if he is not adopted, at least he is under the good hands of the fosterer and until the time that he is totally recovered and strong enough, i have to put Brave back to his colony. i hope Brave is fit and strong enough to be a community cat at my condo. Brave is really a miracle to me, he really wants to survive and he does ! Try to look at the pictures that i attached, his eyes are full of fighting spirit..........

A nice lady found me in Nilam Terraces in Puchong sometime in end April. She asked the neighbourhood guards about me but no one knew who I belonged to and the guards said I'd been wandering around for 2 weeks. The nice lady posted flyers around the area and asked all the Puchong vets about me but after 3 weeks no one has claimed me. So my carer who has a fondness for anime decided to call me Chibi (\"small\" in Japanese) and help me look for a new home. I may be small in stature (only 6kgs!) but will readily bark to alert you to someone at the door! I love to be snuggled - belly rubs are the best! I'm good with other dogs and like playing with small to medium dogs. I have sensitive skin so I hope my human will feed me a good quality diet. I do my potty on the grass or near drainhole covers - my carer thinks I was previously an indoor dog and perhaps potty trained to wee in the bathroom :) Since my past is unknown, I haven't been sent for neutering but please do the responsible thing and spay me after I go on heat if that happens. I'd really like to spend many happy days cuddling on the couch with someone who will tickle my ears and kiss my little apple head - are you the one for me?\" Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 3. Adoption fee of RM to partially cover vaccination, deworming, heartworm test/prevention, tick + flea prevention and skin treatment. 4. If she is found to be intact (i.e. goes on heat), spay after her heat cycle ends. 5. Allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well - for this reason adopters residing in Klang Valley are strongly preferred. 6. Unconditional love :) To help determine if you and the dog you're interested in are a good fit, would appreciate it if you could email with: - A brief intro of yourself - Your experience with dogs if any - Your household situation (what type of home you live in i.e. landed or apartment, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) - Any other pertinent info that will help match you with the right pooch :).

Always calm, cool and collected. Choomi was rescued when she was a tiny 3 weeks old and sickly. Slept on my chest for weeks. But she's a survivor. She's now almost 2, healthy, active, loving, cheeky and chatty. I always talk to her and she'll answer back. They are both house cats, loves basking in the sun on the balcony or windows and much loved. Both are spayed, chipped and vaccinated. They have had their rabies and leukaemia shots as well. I have to put them up for adoption due to unforeseen circumstances and it's a decision which is causing me and my son great pain.

They are still on mothersmilk, but will be ready for adoption in a few weeks. If you are intereted, come and have a look. The canine socialization period takes place between week 6 and 8, and is one of the most important stages of development of the dog. What they learn from their dam and littermates during this period greatly influences the rest of their lives. During this stage the puppies learn bite inhibition and canine socialization skills that are critical skills for a dog, and dogs that miss this stage often have behavioral problems which land them in shelters later in life. They may have serious problems getting along with other dogs, and can have problems with biting, because they never learn to adjust the pressure of their bite, and that teeth hurt..

Nobody has come forward to claim her, and efforts to find a home for her on FB is still fruitless. Tiggy will be an easy cat to care for, as she is independent yet loving, toilet trained and quite neat.

Description: Hugo is an active and robust English bulldog that needs love and attention from the owner. Unfortunately for us, we are unable to provide him the attention that he deserves as we have full time jobs as well as 2 other dogs, a bird and 3 guinea pigs at home to care for! He is a pure pedigree English bulldog, has not been neutered and has been given full vacination as a puppy. Before he is given to his new home, we will give him another round of booster vacination if adviced by the doctor. He stays outside the house in our home at Damansara Heights as he likes running around exercising and due to that, he is not toilet-trained. He is however quite intelligent for a bulldog as he knows how to play throw and fetch and runs away when he knows he is going to get a scolding :) We love him tremendously, but unfortunately, we are not able to keep him. We hope we will be able to find a nice family for him (we would prefer if the family has no other dogs since Hugo can get over-friendly without knowing his size and strength. He also tends to get jealous easily). If there are anybody out there interested in adopting Hugo, please give me a call. We will also interview prospective adopters to see if Hugo is a suitable dog for them. If the need arises, we will also do house visits to see if the house will be a conducive for an active bulldog like Hugo. Please note that we love our dog very much, and therefore, no breeders will be entertained. Preferably KL families only as we want to check future adoptive families' homes to ensure that it is right for our dear Hugo. Thanks :). PhotoAmt: 5.0.", "predicted_label": 4}

I found him near death and with severe, chronic mange, ticks, ulcerated wounds, an ear abscess and severely malnourished. After a few weeks of patient, loving kindness and veterinary attention he is now a very healthy, lively dog with a gentle nature. Brim is a special dog with an unusually gentle nature. It appears Brim may have been abused before being thrown into the street. He is shy around strangers and becomes nervous with loud noises. He would NOT be suitable as a guard dog. His temperament is too soft but he will make a great family pet and so I'm looking for a genuinely loving person or family willing to give Brim a lot of love and freedom to run around. Ideally this would be in a quiet part of the country or in a home with a large garden. I have started training him. He's now house trained, sits and comes on command and will leave the room when told to do so. He is also leash trained and will walk to heel. As I am only visiting Malaysia I need to find Brim a suitable home as a matter of urgency. If interested please email or phone [no messages please].. PhotoAmt: 5.0.", "predicted_label": 4}

Description: When I search through the cats on petfinder for adoption, my heart sank as most cats are cuter, younger and prettier than Ninja. Though I personal understand that chances of him being adopted is as close as 0, but deep down inside me I still hope someone who will have a big heart for him. Ninja is not special or pretty, but in my eyes, he is not any lesser than other prettier cats. He is 6-year-old now, and has never parted with me as he was born in my wardrobe and been with me since then. His mom was a stray that I used to feed and without me knowing she creeped into my wardrobe and gave birth to 3 beautiful babies. Unfortunately his mom passed away after 2 weeks, sent to the vet when found she Ill but was too late to treat. I bottle fed him since the day his mom crossed the bridge. I have 4 cats of my own and I'm being relocated to SG and could only bring 2 cats with me due to circumstances. I would eventually follow my husband to Australia in a few years time from SG and can't afford the expensive pet relocating cost. It kills me to pick which 2 among 4 of them. I'm brining the oldest and Ninja's sister (ex-sporo survival) simply because 1 being the oldest and the other one being an ex sporo patient. Ninja is a very quiet and independent cat. He doesn't like to be held much or pat. It takes a really big heart to love him unconditionally as he is not the huggable type. He needs a permanent home with an owner who loves him despite being a little too 'cool'. I hope someone out there will have a space at home and a big heart to take him in and love him.

Description: Gabby is a beautiful sleek black puppy, estimated to be at 3 months old when she turned up. That was in March . Gabby is a lovely quiet dog that hardly barks. She loves to sit and watch us when we are gardening, or sit with us when we are at ease at the porch area. Our friends who visited us, remarked what a gentle soul Gabby is. The children had no problems playing with her as Gabby is not rough. We have recently had a BBQ party & we've received encouraging remarks that Gabby does not paw, bite or disturb any of the guests when they eat or drink. Gabby was lured to our neighborhood by an irresponsible family who was unable to care for her. We gave our home as Gabby's shelter, in order for Gabby to be safe from traffic, pedestrian abuse and harsh outdoor weather. This beautiful puppy is growing up in our compound and is turning out to be a gentle dog who loves long walks, tummy rubs, sitting with us during evenings, and lots of loving attention. We would like to find Gabby a forever home with a loving family as we are unable to be home at all times. Our job takes us on long outstation trips, and it makes it difficult for us to care for her in the long term. While we are not around, our neighbours are understanding enough to watch over her until we get back. Should anyone be interested in adopting this gentle black female pup, do contact me. I will reply as soon as I am able. FAQs Q : Is Gabby trained in anyway? A : Yes. Gabby's been sent for a Temperament Testing by a professional dog trainer. Gabby is also trained to know Basic Obedience commands (eg; Sit, Stay, Down...etc). Should Gabby's adoption be successful, the adopter will inherit her original file as proof of the training she has gone through, including the contacts of the dog trainer. Q : Will Gabby defecate / soil our porch area? A : No. We have trained her to understand that she is to do her business only while outside of the home. The adopter(s) must commit to walking Gabby twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening, everyday. Q : How long should these dog walks be? A : Anything from 15mins and above should do the trick. As long as Gabby gets her walks, gets to do her business, she will be a happy dog. And a happy dog makes a happy master :) Q : Is Gabby spayed, dewormed and generally checked for good health? A : Yes. Her medical records are all with our trusted vet. You will also be given her medical book for proof and as a reference to her visits to the vet. Q : Why the fees? A : We have taken pains to ensure that Gabby's properly vaccinated, dewormed, anti-flea/ticks, fed healthily, socialised (used to human interactions) and above all, trained for Basic Obedience commands to allow the adopter to have a much more easier time with the new pet. Our fees includes : 1. A sleeping cot 2. her favourite toys 3. medical book 4. file & certificate (certified by a pro trainer) 5. Walking leash & collar Q : I / We have never had a pet dog before, how will I know if I am doing the right thing? A : Don't worry. We will spend time with you and Gabby to teach you how to maintain her good habits and training in order for the transition to go smoothly. This will usually take about 2 to 3 hours. Should you have any questions, you may contact us for further advise as well. We will be happy to help you feel at ease with your newly adopted pet until you are ready to be on your own with Gabby. Temperament Testing & The Suitable Adopter : As Gabby has undergone a professional Temperament Test by our trusted dog trainer, we are delighted to share with you on the sort of suitable owner(s) she will be comfortable with. 1. If you are a family, your children should be at the age of 12 or above, and will not be afraid of dogs. All family members should also be responsible, take turns for practising & maintaining Gabby's training to ensure her obedience. 2. If you are a single person, you should be one of a stable routine & with a commitment to taking care of Gabby for the rest of her life. In return, you will have the most loyal and affectionate companion for life. 3. Gabby has been tested as a gentle dog with a friendly disposition. She is not aggressive nor is she territorial. She will love any attention you can give her, but she is also capable of being on her own most of the times as long as her basic needs (daily walks, food, drinks, play, training) are met. 4. Gabby is good on her own as the only dog in the household. If you have another dog, and would like to adopt Gabby as a companion, it would be advisable if your dog is also given a temperament test to determine if your dog is compatible with Gabby. Gabby is Not Good with aggressive and dominant dogs. Also note, if you wish to have Gabby as a companion to your existing dog, all her training could be for naught if your dog is not trained to listen to commands. Preferential treatment will render all of Gabby's training useless. 5. If you have a cat, have no fear! Gabby is friendly and docile towards felines of all kinds. In fact, Gabby is a cat-magnet in our neighbourhood. To date, she has \"rescued\" two kittens (one adopted, one in foster care) and is not aggressive towards cats, she just wants to play with them mostly. 6. Gabby has received the first Basic Obedience Training. Should you wish to pursue the next course, she is ready for the second stage : Intermediate Training (with more detailed & varied disciplinary commands). Requirements for adoption : As we have faced many set backs in regards to the adoption of our rescued pets, we would like for any potential adopters to meet these basic criterias before contacting us : 1. As an adopter, you should have your own landed property (not rental - neither owned by the company you work for nor renting under another name). This is to avoid any future problems such as re-homing the pet. 2. As an adopter, you should have a stable & existing job to provide for the adopted pet's every need. 3. Adopted pets should never ever be abandoned again if you feel incapable in providing for them. 4. As an adopter, you must realise that when you take on a pet, they will be an addition to your life in every aspect of every way. Adopting a pet is akin to adopting another family member. Love is not enough as all manner of care, responsibility & commitment to their happiness will be in your hands. If you have any doubts, please carefully reconsider all these points mentioned above, so that we may spare the pet (and us) of any unnecessary stress. We love all of our rescues and treat them like our own kids, but we also discipline them without favour. We'd like you to think of them as your own kids too.. PhotoAmt: 5.0.", "predicted_label": 4}

Simba loves to be petted and wouldn't hesitate coming up to you for some attention. Simba was a stray cat that approached me in a parking lot. I noticed he was sneezing and coughing and brought him to the vet where he was diagnosed with a common cold. Simba is currently on medication and is scheduled for his vaccination and to be neutered soon. He is the most adorable and trusting cat I have ever came across and I wouldn't have hesitated to have adopt him myself, but sadly is unable to due to financial and time constraints. Simba is looking for a forever home and strongly prefers to be kept indoors all the time. He also hopes his new parents would follow up on his subsequent vaccinations, not to mention give him lots of love. Simba is litter-trained and eats both dry and wet food. Pet carrier, litter box, water bowl and scratching board included. Do contact me on whatsapp if you're interested!. PhotoAmt: 10.0.", "predicted_label": 4}
